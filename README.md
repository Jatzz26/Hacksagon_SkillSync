SKILLSYNC => SkillSync is a mentorship platform designed to connect junior developers with seniors and batchmates. We cut through the noise of traditional networking to create meaningful, productive relationships that accelerate growth.

Why SkillSync?
68% of junior developers report feeling unprepared for real-world challenges. Senior engineers waste 23% of their time solving problems that could be delegated. The tech industry loses $30B annually due to knowledge gaps between experience levels. SkillSync solves these problems by creating structured mentorship relationships.
